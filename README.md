# heart-disease-project
This is a heart disease classification machine learning project. 
It was created while following the Complete Machine Learning & Data Science Bootcamp by Andrei Neagoie and Daniel Bourke.
I also did some independent experimentation with Hyperparameter tuning and model performance.
